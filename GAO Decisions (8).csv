Plaintiff’s argument is unsupported by caselaw. The Court is required to award a high degree of deference to the agency’s evaluation. Advanced Data Concepts, 216 F.3d at 1058. Plaintiff cites no requirement in statute, regulation, or caselaw for the agency to tether its findings justifying a higher technical rating for [XXX] to the specific point of contention plaintiff has with the agency’s evaluation—it was rational for the agency to find smaller teams proposed by both [XXX] and Harmonia “Decrease[] Confidence” in their “Technical Approaches,” but independent reasons “Increase[] Confidence” in [XXX]’s based on the record evidence. See AR at 360 (Harmonia Evaluation); AR at 364 ([XXX] Evaluation); Ala. Aircraft, 586 F.3d at 1375.

For example, LPE notes that, in evaluating LPE’s proposal, the agency made<b> “only a general reference” to LPES’s experience performing case processing requirements, and complains that its proposal “[i]n fact . . . showcases its team’s deep experience with this work.”[18] Id. at 19.

Finally, LPES maintains that, in evaluating MPZA’s proposal under the technical approach factor, the agency should have “juxtaposed” LPE’s and MPZA’s proposals and, on that basis, assigned a “low confidence” rating to MPZA’s proposal.[19] Id. at 19‑23.

The protester argues that the agency should have found the PPQ from MicroTechnologies’s major subcontractor to be relevant because it involved services at 70 facilities, similar to the 58 locations to be served under the current requirement.

As a result, the Agency assigned a weakness under Factor 1. Plaintiff bases its argument on the Solicitation’s terms regarding Factor 4 (Past Performance), which states that an “[o]fferor will not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably if it lacks relevant past performance.” AR 148. In response, defendant and defendant-intervenor argue that plaintiff “conflates experience and past performance suggest that the Agency cannot downgrade experience” under Factor 1.
<br>
<br>The Court is unconvinced by plaintiff’s arguments. Here, FEMA’s evaluation of plaintiff’s proposal is consistent with the terms of the Solicitation. The Solicitation clearly states that the evaluation of Factor 1 is separate from Factor 4 Moreover, this distinction is clear because the Solicitation defines Factor 1 (Relevant Prior Experience) and Factor 4 (Past Performance). AR 141, 148. Under Factor 1, offerors detail their experience addressing three components&%2358; (1) experience directly supporting the NFIP; (2) experience supporting the review, process, appeals of flood insurance claims; and (3) experience leading and implementing change management efforts. AR 141. In comparison, under Factor 4, offerors are evaluated on (1) quality of service provided, (2) cost control, (3) timeliness, (4) management, and (5) customer service. AR 148. Accordingly, the Agency treated these Factors as distinct and separate from one another in its evaluation. For Factor 1, the Agency evaluated plaintiff and assigned a weakness because plaintiff did not provide a LOC for its subcontractor in order for the Agency to include the subcontractor’s experience as part of plaintiff’s proposal. AR 1297. For Factor 4, the Agency did not assign plaintiff’s proposal a weakness for lacking relevant past performance. Indeed, plaintiff received the highest rating under Factor 4, a rating of “High Confidence” from the Agency. AR 1324.

<br>
<br>The vast majority of proposed labor categories (LCATs) from each team member’s Multiple Award Schedule (MAS) do not expressly state that the positions will be filled by personnel that meet the minimum qualification requirement. For example, Communications Consultant II is quoted for many functional areas and levels, and the MAS PD [position description] states that the position requires “5+ years” of experience. This could be interpreted as not having the required experience for Levels III (7-10 years) or IV (10+), and there are instances of this across much of your crosswalk submission. Therefore, Mobomo must be able to affirmatively state that each position cross-walked to the PWS [performance work statement] LCATs will meet the minimum experience for each PWS LCAT level (I through IV).
<br>
<br>In response to the agency’s discussion question, Mobomo replied as follows&%2358; “As requested, Mobomo confirms that each position cross-walked to the PWS LCATs will meet the minimum experience for each PWS LCAT level (I through IV).” AR, Exh. 9, Mobomo Final Proposal Revision, at 1, 4-5.

In both SDS International and Ginn Group, the protesters challenged the agency’s reliance on an undisclosed estimate. SDS Int’l v. United States, 48 Fed. Cl. 742, 758 (2001); Ginn Grp., Inc. v. United States, 159 Fed. Cl. 593, 605–06 (2022). In this case, plaintiff disputes the agency’s use of a disclosed estimate. The agency disclosed the estimate in response to a question Harmonia asked. AR at 94 (Harmonia Questions Submission Email); AR at 113 (Second FMCSA Resps.). Plaintiff acknowledges SDS International is different from the present case, Tr. at 32&%2358;16–24, and it has not provided a case in which this court has held an agency may not rely on a disclosed estimate.3&%23160; See Pl.’s MJAR; Pl.’s MJAR Resp. &amp; Reply. An agency’s reliance on an undisclosed estimate is entirely different than the agency’s reliance on a disclosed estimate, as bidders are on notice and can explain deviations in their proposals. The bidders here were on notice the agency anticipated seven FTEs would be optimal for completion of the solicited work. See AR at 113 (Second FMCSA Resps.). Harmonia was particularly on notice because it asked a question regarding the agency’s anticipated number of FTEs and labor categories, and the agency responded directly. AR at 94 (Harmonia Questions Submission Email); AR at 113 (Second FMCSA Resps.). The Court disagrees with plaintiff’s assertion it is a “red herring” to consider the disclosed nature of the estimate. See Pl.’s MJAR Resp. &amp; Reply at 6. The bidders’ knowledge of the agency’s estimated FTEs supports the agency’s application of the estimate. The TEP used the disclosed staffing estimate to ensure each bidder would be able to successfully complete the solicited work. If the bidder did not propose a sufficient team, the TEP considered whether the bidder provided explanation for its decision to deviate from the estimate. AR at 360 (Harmonia Evaluation); AR at 364 ([XXX] Evaluation). The disclosed nature of the staffing estimate is meaningful for the Court’s evaluation of the agency’s application of the estimate. The Court therefore finds SDS International and Ginn Group are distinguishable. The Court holds there was a rational basis for the TEP to look for an explanation from the bidders who deviated from the staffing estimate because each bidder was on notice of the estimate.

Peraton also alleges that NRO improperly discounted the major weaknesses in AT&amp;amp;T’s technical proposal while improperly magnifying the significance of Peraton’s one major technical weakness. We find Peraton’s argument of unequal treatment here to be both misplaced and without merit. The protester engages in a mathematical counting of one sub-component of the agency’s evaluation findings (i.e., major weaknesses), and argues, essentially, that “three is bigger than one.” As a preliminary matter, Peraton ignores the fact that all major weaknesses were not equal to each other, given the relative importance of the technical approach standards against which they were assessed.

Based on our review of the record, we find nothing unreasonable in the agency’s assessment of confidence decreases to the protester’s quotation based on CORMAC’s responses to challenge question 1 of the oral presentation.</b></div>","Innovation","[""Oral Presentations""]","https://www.gao.gov/products/b-421532%2Cb-421532.2%23mt=e-report",,"214"

Trillion 2nd Supp. MOL at 20.<br><br><div>Our Office has stated that consistent with the objective of allowing for streamlined procurements under the FSS program, in the context of a FAR subpart 8.4 procurement, the agency’s evaluation judgments must be documented in sufficient detail to show that they are reasonable.

At the same time, we have found that apart from documenting evaluation judgments, subpart 8.4 does not expressly require an agency to record or otherwise transcribe the content of the vendors’ oral presentation.

Consulting, Inc., B-285777, Oct. 10, 2000, 2001 CPD ¶ 132 (in procurements conducted under FAR part 15, agencies are required to maintain a record of oral presentations, which can include retaining government notes, copies of offeror briefing slides or presentation notes). <br></div><div><br></div>Our review of the record here shows sufficient--albeit sparse--documentation of the agency’s evaluation conclusions about vendors’ oral presentations.

See Excelicon AR, Tab J, Phase 2 TER; Trillion AR, Tab H, Phase 2 TER.  There is no further requirement in law or regulation that mandates documenting oral presentations in procurements conducted under FAR subpart 8.4, and it is not our role to impose one where the FAR does not.
